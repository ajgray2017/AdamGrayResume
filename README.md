# Adam Gray's Resume Projects
# UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

Including projects from my BS in computer science from UNCW, along with projects I have worked on outside of school in order to show proficiency in other areas of computer science. I am confident in my development skills, and my ability to pick a new language very rapidly. I am very interested in back-end development, I love all the problem solving that comes along with it. However, I am able to work in a front-end enviroment as I recogize is a critical part of the development life cycle, and I love a challenge.

# (Un)Intuitive Calculator 
[Python]
> A caluclator, currently allowing functionality up to 500. 
> With operations including:
> - addition
> - subtraction
> - multiplication
> - division
> - modulos
>
> Made to as a joke, there are over 2.5 million lines of if statements for every possible subset of x operation y = z. There would be more, but this is the largest I could go and still allow the base git functionality. 

# A* Pathfinding Snake Game (In Progress) 
[JS, CSS, HTML]
> Using JS, CSS, and HMTL I have started building a web based snake game, that can be played by a person or by using the A* algorythm.

# CSC 450 Final Project 
[Python, SQLite]
> While at the University North Carolina Wilmington, I attended the Software Engineering course CSC 450. We built  a web based bird identifier, using IBM Watson's Visual Recognition processes, an SQLite database and Python. 

# CSC 455 Final Project 
[Java, SQL]
> While at the University North Carolina Wilmington, I attended the Database Management course CSC 455, we were tasked with creating and implementing a database from scratch. Alex, my partner, having expeirence in the food service industry, came up with the idea to make a restaurant POS system. This database is setup for the use of cooks and servers, to create, complete, and return a customers order, while holding a mutable count of the current on hand stock of ingredients and past/present orders.
