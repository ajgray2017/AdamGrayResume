# Adam Gray's Resume Projects
# UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

Including projects from my BS in computer science from UNCW, along with projects I have worked on outside of school in order to show proficiency in other areas of computer science. I am confident in my development skills, and my ability to pick a new language very rapidly. I am very interested in back-end development, I love all the problem solving that comes along with it. However, I am able to work in a front-end environment as I recognize is a critical part of the development life cycle, and I love a challenge.

# CSC 475 Final Project
[Python]
> While at the University North Carolina Wilmington, I attended the Topics in Computer Science and Technology: Computer Security course. We focusing on computer security across the board, and these were some of my favorite projects from the course. I wrote the botnet to have the smallest possible slaves, and allow for the command & control server to send any modular payload wanted through a pickled object. 

# (Un)Intuitive Calculator 
[Python]
> A calculator, currently allowing functionality up to 500. 
> With operations including:
> - addition
> - subtraction
> - multiplication
> - division
> - modulos
>
> Made to as a joke, there are over 2.5 million lines of if statements for every possible subset of x operation y = z. There would be more, (I got it up to over 100 million lines) but this is the largest I could go and still allow the base git functionality. 

# A* Pathfinding Snake Game (In Progress) 
[JS, CSS, HTML]
> Using JS, CSS, and HMTL I have started building a web-based snake game, that can be played by a person or by using the A* algorithm.

# CSC 450 Final Project 
[Python, SQLite]
> While at the University North Carolina Wilmington, I attended the Software Engineering course CSC 450. We built a web-based bird identifier, using IBM Watson's Visual Recognition processes, an SQLite database, and Python. 

# CSC 455 Final Project 
[Java, SQL]
> While at the University North Carolina Wilmington, I attended the Database Management course CSC 455, we were tasked with creating and implementing a database from scratch. Alex, my partner, having experience in the foodservice industry, came up with the idea to make a restaurant POS system. This database is set up for the use of cooks and servers, to create, complete, and return a customer's order, while holding a mutable count of the current on-hand stock of ingredients and past/present orders.
